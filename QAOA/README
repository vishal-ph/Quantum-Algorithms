You can use this notebook as an introductory example; intended for beginners learning about Quantum Computing with QISKIT. (I 
tried to make it as self-contained as possible)
\
This code implements the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to solve a simple maxcut problem on unweighted random graphs.
The outer loop classical optimization for circuit parameters is implemented as a brute-force search on the parameter set.
The code is generic in iterative parameter 'p'. Hence, User can specify and obtain results for any 'p' required.
The code by default is implemented on the local machine based qiskit.Aer quantum computer simulator but, it can be changed 
by specifiying a different backend.
